# Fusion

Repository for Fusion plugin for Simple Ores, by AlexndrGr8st, maintained by Sinhika.

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod that he made free to all to borrow, in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it.

**WARNING: 1.15 is a Work-in-Progress; expect frequent changes!**

TO-DO
-----
* add output to front of fusion furnace as well.
* add JEI support
* make recipes disable-able in config.
* update or move the SimpleOres, etc. wiki
