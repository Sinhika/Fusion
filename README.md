# Fusion

Repository for Fusion plugin for Simple Ores, by AlexndrGr8st, maintained by Sinhika.

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod that he made free to all to borrow, in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it.

**WARNING: 1.17.1 is a Work-in-Progress; expect frequent changes!**

TO-DO
-----
* [1.17.1] fix copper fusion recycling recipes to yield vanilla copper.
* [1.17.1] fix tool item Tiers (@see SimpleOres for example).
* add shears for rest of metals (bronze, sinisite, thyrium)
* update or move the SimpleOres, etc. wiki
* add ingots/tools/armor to appropriate villager trade tables.
* <s>add JEI support</s>  Basic JEI support done. Add remaining JEI support (transfer handler).
* should we add fusion items to monster worn/carried items? Probably not, that leads to tears.
* add output to front of fusion furnace as well -- Why?
* add chance of fusion furnace in villages, and if exists, **increased** chance of bronze or steel stuff in toolsmith & weaponsmith chest loot. If the latter is feasible. This involves structures. I don't want to
do structures.
