# Fusion

Repository for Fusion plugin for Simple Ores, by AlexndrGr8st, maintained by Sinhika.

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod that he made free to all to borrow, in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it.

**WARNING: 1.15 is a Work-in-Progress; expect frequent changes!**

TO-DO
-----
* <s>add JEI support</s>  Basic JEI support done. Add remaining JEI support (transfer handler).
* <s>make recipes disable-able in config.</s>
* Roll the fusion recycling part of akkamaddi's Addenda into Fusion - in progress.

* add chance of fusion furnace in villages, and if exists, chance of bronze or steel stuff in toolsmith & weaponsmith chest loot.
